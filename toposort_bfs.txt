Topological sort  can be implemented using both the Graph Traversal Techniques i.e. BFS AND DFS
In BFS we use the concept of indegree in which the independent node (node whose indegree is 0)is push into the queue
While in DFS we just go through the normal process and push the nodes into stack n iterate over the stack to get the desired result.
Whenever you encounter any dependency situation in your question , you must check to apply Topological Sort.
